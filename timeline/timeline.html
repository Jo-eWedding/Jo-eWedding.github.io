        <h1>Senior Year</h1>
        <p class="desc">Joe and Joanne still saw each other in the music hallway even though he was not in choir anymore, but he hung around for other reasons *cough cough* he had a crush on Joanne *cough cough*. During this season of CyberPatriot, they were on the same team and found themselves growing closer. The two even considered each other to be best friends.
          A week before senior prom, neither Joe nor Joanne had a date. Joanne was getting anxious. She asked her best friend Hanna if she should ask Joe, to which she replied ‚Äúyes‚Äù. Joe had considered asking Joanne to prom, but assumed she would turn him down. When Joanne asked Joe to prom, he was pleasantly surprised and said ‚Äúof course I‚Äôll go to prom with you!‚Äù At first, Joanne said she just wanted to go as friends, and Joe respected that. They started talking more and ended up making it official. It just made sense and felt right. üíñ 
          In May, they both graduated from Lee‚Äôs Summit North High School as Class of 2016.

        <h1>Summer Lovin'</h1>
        <p class="desc">Joanne jumped right into college by taking 7 credit hours at Metropolitan Community College-Longview. Joe had been accepted into University of Missouri-Columbia (or Mizzou), but he didn‚Äôt start until the fall.
          When Joanne wasn‚Äôt in class, the new couple spent pretty much every moment they could together. To quote the musical Grease, ‚ÄúSummer lovin‚Äô, had me a blast // Summer lovin‚Äô happened so fast‚Äù.

        <h1>College</h1>
        <p class="desc">When Joe left for college, they were both sad and nervous. Joanne stayed in Lee‚Äôs Summit to finish her Associates at MCC. Their relationship turned long distance, and they really missed each other. They stayed in constant contact via text message, and Joanne would take the train from Lee‚Äôs Summit to Jefferson City. Joe would pick her up from the train station and they would spend weekends together. Joe and Joanne supported each other through the stress of college and some rocky paths, and their relationship grew stronger.
          Joanne graduated in December 2019, while Joe graduated in May 2020

        <p class="desc">Once Joe graduated, he and Joanne were finally reunited. They both had full-time jobs and spent time together when they could. After saving up some money, they moved in together in August 2021. 
          On January 24th, 2023, Joe popped the question. Joanne was surprised because she didn‚Äôt think this was going to happen any time soon. She said yes (of course) and here we are now. :) </p>
